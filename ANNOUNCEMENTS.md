Excited to announce the release of OMNIX - a new programming language designed from the ground up for distributed systems and blockchain applications!

Key Features:
• Built-in consensus protocols (Raft, PBFT, Tendermint)
• Native cross-chain smart contract support
• Automatic geographic distribution and load balancing
• Byzantine fault tolerance
• Edge-to-cloud orchestration

OMNIX makes planet-scale computing simple with intuitive syntax for complex distributed patterns.

Now available on VS Code Marketplace with full syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and code snippets.

**Title:** OMNIX - A new programming language for distributed systems (Now on VS Code Marketplace)

```markdown
Hey r/programming!

I'm excited to share OMNIX, a new programming language specifically designed for distributed systems and blockchain applications. It's now available on the VS Code Marketplace!

## What makes OMNIX different?

Unlike traditional languages that treat distribution as an afterthought, OMNIX has distributed computing primitives built into the language itself:

```omnix
consensus cluster UserService {
    replicas: 5
    consensus: PBFT
    zones: ["us-east", "eu-west", "asia-pacific"]
    
    service handle_request(req: UserRequest) -> Response {
        // Automatically distributed across replicas
        let result = proposal <!> {
            validators: 3,
            timeout: 2000ms
        };
        
        when result.accepted() {
            state <#> result.value;
            broadcast(StateUpdate(state));
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Features:
- **Native Consensus**: Built-in Raft, PBFT, and Tendermint consensus
- **Cross-chain Operations**: Deploy smart contracts across multiple blockchains
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Handle malicious actors gracefully
- **Consensus Operators**: Special operators like `<!>` (propose), `<#>` (merge)
- **Automatic Distribution**: Geographic distribution and load balancing

## VS Code Extension Features:
- Full syntax highlighting
- IntelliSense and auto-completion
- Code snippets for common patterns
- Integrated compiler support

## Get Started:
1. Install VS Code extension: `ext install omnix-lang.omnix-lang`
2. Create a `.omx` file and start coding!

**Title:** Introducing OMNIX: Rethinking Programming for Distributed Systems

```markdown
## The Problem with Distributed Programming

Building distributed systems is hard. We cobble together libraries, frameworks, and protocols, trying to make languages designed for single machines work across networks. What if we could start fresh?

## Enter OMNIX

OMNIX is a new programming language that treats distribution as a first-class citizen. Instead of adding distributed features to an existing language, we built distribution into the syntax itself.

### Your First OMNIX Program

Here's a distributed counter that automatically handles consensus across multiple nodes:

[Include counter example]

### The Magic is in the Operators

OMNIX introduces special operators for distributed operations:
- `<!>` - Submit value to consensus
- `<?>` - Vote on proposals  
- `<#>` - Consensus-safe merge
- `<@>` - Query distributed state

### Real-World Example: Cross-Chain Token Bridge

[Include cross-chain example]

### Getting Started Today

The OMNIX VS Code extension is now live on the marketplace! It includes:
- Syntax highlighting
- IntelliSense
- Code snippets
- Compiler integration

Install: `ext install omnix-lang.omnix-lang`

### What's Next?

We're building:
- Language Server Protocol implementation
- Debugger support
- Package manager
- Production-ready compiler
